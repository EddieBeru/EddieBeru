## Hi there 👋,
I'm Edie, just a programming enthusiast. I'm over here to host my college proyects and some personal works too! I'm still learning but I'm aiming for a professional setting revolving this industry. Nice to meet you! 😁

## A little about me
I'm from Costa Rica, born and raised here. 🇨🇷
I speak Spanish (native) , I have learned English (currently C1 according to several online tests, lol), and I'm on my way to learn German (Probably A1? Vielleicht?).
I know quite a bit how to code in C#, know a little of C++ thanks to my Uni and I'm willing to learn other stuff to fulfill my aspirations.

## Fun fact 🤯
I have a little angel made cat called Dory! She has been an important reason to keep going and never give up. I don't know why since she literally just exists and eats but she has grown to be an important part of my life.

Hope you have fun looking through this even though it isn't that full. 😺
